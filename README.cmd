Simple scheme interpreter in javascript and python


A language interpreter has two parts: Parsing and Execution.

In PARSING it takes an input program in the form of a sequence of characters, verifies it according to the syntactic rules of the language, and translates the program into an internal representation.

In EXECUTION the internal representation is then processed according to the semantic rules of the language, thereby carrying out the computation.
